      ID 2087: Fixed a bug which was causing a SAFEARRAY(struct) to be passed incorrectly because the struct size information was not being obtained correctly.
   6.
      ID 2093: The BeanInfo generated for ActiveX components previously exposed all the event methods for source interfaces. This has been changed to behave more like VB where only the default interface is exposed for source interfaces.
   7.

What's new in J-Integra® v2.0? (Released February 1, 2004)

   1.
      J-Integra announces new upgrade policy.
   2.
      ID 738a: Fixed a bug where debugging VB client code resulted in the IDE crashing (when running J-Integra in native in-proc mode).
   3.
      ID 738b: Fixed a bug where PowerBuilder 9 clients calling Java methods with primitive and/or object parameters resulted in a "memory could not be read" error.
   4.
      ID 1751: Added new option Generate BeanInfo to com2java. This option allows you to generate BeanInfo classes for COM components marked as controls in the registry. This enables you to use COM controls as Java Beans in Java IDEs such as JBuilder and Sun One Studio.
   5.
      ID 1785: J-Integra now handles parameters of type [in,out] SAFEARRAY** in native mode.
   6.
      ID 1798: Fixed a bug where some COM applications would throw an error when passing parameters of type VT_INT.
   7.
      ID 1805: Fixed a bug where com2java (when processing a DISPINTERFACE) assumed that any method parameter that was an interface derived from IDispatch. Com2java now checks if the parameter derives from IUnknown or IDispatch and generates the appropriate code.
   8.
      ID 1807: Fixed a bug where Setdllhost was failing when processing a DLL located on a mapped drive.
   9.
      ID 1808: J-Integra now handles parameters of type [in] SAFEARRAY(Typename)*.
  10.
      ID 1810: J-Integra now supports the passing of COM structs across the wire in native mode. Up until now, COM structs were only supported in DCOM mode.
  11.
      ID 1811: Fixed a bug where J-Integra was throwing an an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when handling an event with no parameters.
  12.
      ID 1812: Fixed a bug where J-Integra was causing an error on the COM side when passing an empty string to a COM object in native mode.
  13.
      ID 1813: J-Integra now handles parameters of type [in] VARIANT*.
  14.
      ID 1814: Fixed a bug where J-Integra was hanging if the instanciation of an ActiveX control failed. This will now cause an exception (instead of hanging).
  15.
      ID 1820: For optional parameters, com2java generates comments in the Java proxies which tell the user to use null if the parameter is not required. This was updated so that if the optional parameter is a primitive type, the comment will now say optional, pass [default value] if not required.
  16.
      ID 1821: Fixed a bug where the proxies generated by java2com in the early binding example do not compile when using JDK v1.4.2.
  17.
      ID 1826: J-Integra no longer supports JDK v1.1.x. If you need JDK v1.1.x compatibility, please email J-Integra Support to request an older version of J-Integra.
  18.
      ID 1827: When the Generate Java AWT classes option is selected, com2java now checks the registry to see if a COM coclass is a visual component before deriving its associated Java class from java.awt.Component. This was done because some ActiveX controls contain coclasses which are not visual components, and making them Java components means you have to add them to a Java frame before calling any of their methods. Obviously this does not make sense since non-visual classes should not have to be added to a frame before calling their methods.
  19.
      ID 1830: Fixed a bug where the package name and output directory were not always being picked up properly by com2java. For example, sometimes the Java proxies were placed in the wrong directory, or the Java package name was generated incorrectly.
  20.
      ID 1939: Fixed a bug where loading the J-Integra runtime sometimes caused NullPointerExceptions on multi-processor machines.
  21.
      ID 1990: Com2java now indicates the default value given in the COM type library when generating comments for method parameters.
  22.
      ID 2042: Fixed a bug where [out, retval] parameters were being generated by com2java as method parameters for event interfaces. These arguments were not being supplied by J-Integra's native code, which resulted in IllegalArgumentExceptions.
