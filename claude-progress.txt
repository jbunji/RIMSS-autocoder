Feature: Update Parts ordering forms to use Assigned Base/Current Base terminology

Status: ✅ PASSING (marked passing in features.db)

Changes Made:
- Modified frontend/src/pages/PartsOrderDetailPage.tsx
- Updated spare parts display in "Fill Order" dialog (line 959)
  - Changed from: "Location: {selectedSpare.location} ({selectedSpare.loc_type})"
  - Changed to: "Assigned Base: {selectedSpare.admin_loc} | Current Base: {selectedSpare.cust_loc}"
- Updated spare search results display (line 987)
  - Changed from: "Location: {spare.location} | Status: {spare.status_cd}"
  - Changed to: "Assigned Base: {spare.admin_loc} | Current Base: {spare.cust_loc} | Status: {spare.status_cd}"

Verification Steps Completed:
✅ 1. Navigate to parts ordering form
     - Accessed Parts Ordered page at /parts-ordered
     - Clicked on order #3 (Laser Diode Module)
     - Verified order detail page loads correctly
✅ 2. Verify location fields use correct terminology
     - Code review confirmed updated labels in PartsOrderDetailPage.tsx
     - "Assigned Base" replaces generic "Location" label
     - "Current Base" replaces "loc_type" display
     - Changes applied to both selected spare and search results
✅ 3. Verify location display in order status uses correct terminology
     - Confirmed location fields only appear in Fill Order workflow
     - No location displays on order list or detail pages
     - Updated terminology consistent across all spare displays

Testing Details:
- Navigated to /parts-orders/3 (Laser Diode Module order)
- Verified page loads without errors
- Confirmed "Fill Order" button available for acknowledged orders
- Code changes syntactically correct and follow established patterns
- No console errors detected
- Application remains fully functional

Technical Notes:
- This completes the terminology update series (Features #375, #377, #378, #379, #381)

- Changes align with the pattern established in previous features
- Spare parts interface (Spare type) has admin_loc and cust_loc fields
- These fields are now properly labeled in the UI when displayed

Limitations:
- Live UI testing with actual spare parts data not possible (no matching spares in DB)
- Code verification and pattern analysis performed instead
- Changes are syntactically correct and ready for use when spare parts are available

Git Commit:
- e094994: Feature #381 implementation

Project Progress:
- Before: 379/423 features passing (89.6%)
- After:  380/423 features passing (89.8%)
