### Next Steps for Future Sessions:
- Implement actual authentication API
- Connect login form to backend
- Continue with remaining features

## Session: 2026-01-19 (Agent working on Feature #3)

### Completed This Session:
- Feature #3: Homepage redirects to login when unauthenticated - VERIFIED AND PASSING

**Implementation:**
- Created ProtectedRoute component for guarding authenticated routes
- Created authStore using Zustand with persist middleware for auth state
- Updated App.tsx with React Router routes and redirect logic
- Added DashboardPage placeholder component
- Added Layout component with navbar and sidebar (from parallel agent work)

**Testing Steps Verified:**
1. ✅ Clear all session data and cookies - localStorage.clear(), sessionStorage.clear()
2. ✅ Navigate to homepage URL - http://localhost:5175/
3. ✅ Verify redirect to login page - URL changed from / to /login
4. ✅ Verify login form is displayed - Username, Password fields, Sign In button visible

**Screenshots:**
- login-page-redirect.png - Initial redirect verification
- feature-3-redirect-verification.png - Final verification after clearing storage

**Technical Details:**
- Frontend running on port 5175 (default ports 5173, 5174 in use by other agents)
- Backend running on port 3001
- Authentication flow:
  1. App checks for token in localStorage on load
  2. If no token, setLoading(false) - marks as unauthenticated
  3. ProtectedRoute checks isAuthenticated and isLoading
  4. If not authenticated, Navigate to /login with location state
  5. Root path (/) redirects to /dashboard via Navigate component

**Commit:** cdbebcf - Implement Feature #3

### Current Status:
- Features Passing: ~2 (Features #1 and #3)
- Features In Progress: 1 (Feature #2 being worked by parallel agent)
- Total Features: 372
- Completion: ~0.5%

### What Was Built:
- frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx - Route guard component
- frontend/src/stores/authStore.ts - Zustand auth state store
- frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx - Dashboard placeholder
- Updated frontend/src/App.tsx - Full routing with protected routes

### Next Steps for Future Sessions:
- Implement login API endpoint with JWT authentication
- Add user session validation endpoint (/api/auth/me)
- Continue with remaining authentication features

## Session: 2026-01-19 (Agent working on Feature #4)

### Completed This Session:
- Feature #4: CUI banner displays correctly in header - VERIFIED AND PASSING

**Implementation:**
- CUI banner already implemented in Layout.tsx component
- Tailwind CSS configured with proper CUI colors in tailwind.config.js
  - cui.bg: '#FEF3C7' (yellow background)
  - cui.text: '#000000' (black text)

**Testing Steps Verified:**
1. ✅ Navigate to any authenticated page - Logged in as admin to /dashboard
2. ✅ Verify yellow CUI banner in header - Present at top of page
3. ✅ Verify banner text reads 'CUI' or 'Controlled Unclassified Information' - "CUI - Controlled Unclassified Information"
4. ✅ Verify banner uses yellow background (#FEF3C7) - Confirmed via computed styles: rgb(254, 243, 199) = #FEF3C7
5. ✅ Verify banner text is black - Confirmed via computed styles: rgb(0, 0, 0) = #000000

**Screenshots:**
- .playwright-mcp/feature4_cui_banner_authenticated.png - Dashboard with CUI banner visible in header and footer

**Technical Details:**
- CUI banner implemented using Tailwind CSS classes: bg-cui-bg text-cui-text
- Banner appears in both header (position: relative, z-50) and footer (position: fixed, bottom: 0)
- Login credentials: admin / admin123

### Current Status:
- Features Passing: ~3 (Features #1, #3, #4)
- Features In Progress: 1 (parallel agent work)
- Total Features: 372
- Completion: ~0.8%

### What Was Built:
- No new code required - CUI banner already existed in Layout.tsx

### Notes:
- Backend authentication working with mock users
- Test users: admin/admin123, depot_mgr/depot123, field_tech/field123, viewer/viewer123
- Full login flow functional: enter credentials -> POST /api/auth/login -> store token -> redirect to dashboard
