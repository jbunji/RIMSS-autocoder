- Created authStore using Zustand with persist middleware for auth state
- Updated App.tsx with React Router routes and redirect logic
- Added DashboardPage placeholder component
- Added Layout component with navbar and sidebar (from parallel agent work)

**Testing Steps Verified:**
1. ✅ Clear all session data and cookies - localStorage.clear(), sessionStorage.clear()
2. ✅ Navigate to homepage URL - http://localhost:5175/
3. ✅ Verify redirect to login page - URL changed from / to /login
4. ✅ Verify login form is displayed - Username, Password fields, Sign In button visible

**Testing Steps Verified:**
1. ✅ Log in as any user - Logged in as admin/admin123
2. ✅ Wait for token to approach expiration - Used 5000ms test override
3. ✅ Verify refresh token request is made - Console: "[TokenRefreshManager] Initiating token refresh..."
4. ✅ Verify new access token is received - Console: "[TokenRefreshManager] Token refreshed successfully"
   - Initial token: eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsImlhdCI6MTc2ODg0MjAzNDU4MCwiZXhwIjoxNzY4ODQzODM0NTgwfQ==
   - Refreshed token: eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsImlhdCI6MTc2ODg0MjA0NDYwOSwiZXhwIjoxNzY4ODQzODQ0NjA5fQ==

- Backend logs all refresh events for debugging
- Component handles edge cases: visibility change, concurrent refresh prevention


## Testing Session: 2026-01-19 12:04

[Testing] Feature #8 'User can log out' - REGRESSION FOUND AND FIXED

**Regression Found:**
- CORS configuration was hardcoded to only allow http://localhost:5173
- When port 5173 was in use, Vite started on port 5174
- This caused "Access to fetch... from origin" CORS errors
- Login and logout (all API calls) were failing with ERR_FAILED

**Root Cause:**
- backend/src/index.ts line 13 had: `origin: 'http://localhost:5173'`
- Needed to accept multiple ports for development flexibility

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated CORS middleware to use dynamic origin validation
- Now accepts ports 5173, 5174, 5175 on both localhost and 127.0.0.1
- Still respects FRONTEND_URL environment variable

**Verification Steps Passed:**
1. ✅ Log in as any user - Logged in as admin/admin123
2. ✅ Click user menu in header - Opened dropdown showing user info
3. ✅ Click logout button - Clicked "Sign out" menu item
4. ✅ Verify redirect to login page - URL changed to /login
5. ✅ Verify JWT token is cleared - `token: null` in localStorage
6. ✅ Verify session data is cleared - `currentProgramId: null` in localStorage
7. ✅ Verify cannot access protected routes - /dashboard redirects to /login
8. ✅ No console errors detected

**Commit:** 8392a03 - Fix CORS regression: allow multiple localhost ports

[Testing] Session complete - fixed regression in feature #8
