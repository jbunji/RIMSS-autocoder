## Session: 2026-01-19 (Agent working on Feature #63)

### Completed This Session:
- Feature #63: Configuration filtered by program - VERIFIED AND PASSING

**Description:** Users only see configurations for assigned programs

**Implementation Status:**
The configuration filtering by program was already implemented in the backend. This session verified the feature works correctly through comprehensive browser automation testing.

**Backend Implementation (already present):**
- GET /api/configurations endpoint filters by program_id query parameter
- If no program specified, uses user's default program
- Non-admin users can only access configurations for their assigned programs
- Admin users can switch between all programs using the program selector

**Frontend Implementation (already present):**
- Program selector in header allows switching between assigned programs
- ConfigurationsPage fetches configurations with current program_id
- Header displays: "Viewing configurations for [PROGRAM_CODE] - [PROGRAM_NAME]"
- Configuration count updates based on selected program

**Verification Steps Completed:**
1. ✅ Log in as user with single program (field_tech - CRIIS only)
2. ✅ Navigate to Configurations page
3. ✅ Verify only program-specific configs display:
   - field_tech sees 4 CRIIS configurations only

## Session: 2026-01-19 (Agent working on Feature #8)

### Completed This Session:
- Feature #8: User can log out - VERIFIED AND PASSING

**Implementation:**
- Logout functionality was already implemented by previous agents
- Navbar.tsx has handleLogout function that calls authStore.logout() and navigates to /login
- authStore.logout() clears: user, token, isAuthenticated, isLoading, currentProgramId
- Backend has POST /api/auth/logout endpoint (mock implementation)

**Testing Steps Verified:**
1. ✅ Log in as any user - Logged in as admin/admin123
2. ✅ Click user menu in header - Opened user menu dropdown showing user info
3. ✅ Click logout button - Clicked "Sign out" button in user menu
4. ✅ Verify redirect to login page - URL changed from /dashboard to /login
5. ✅ Verify JWT token is cleared - Token in localStorage changed from JWT string to null
6. ✅ Verify session data is cleared - currentProgramId changed from 1 to null
7. ✅ Verify cannot access protected routes - Navigating to /dashboard and /assets redirects to /login

**localStorage Before Logout:**
```json
{"state":{"token":"eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsImlhdCI6MTc2ODg0MTcxMjM5NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY4ODQzNTEyMzk1fQ==","currentProgramId":1},"version":0}
```

**localStorage After Logout:**
```json
{"state":{"token":null,"currentProgramId":null},"version":0}
```

**Screenshots:**

  - Visibility change handling for tab switching
- Added sessionExpired state to authStore
- Updated LoginPage to display session expiration warning message
- Session timeout set to 30 minutes as per spec (configurable via localStorage for testing)

**Testing Steps Verified:**
1. ✅ Log in as any user - Logged in as admin/admin123
2. ✅ Simulate 30 minutes of inactivity - Used 5-second timeout override for testing
3. ✅ Attempt to perform any action - Timer expired while on dashboard
4. ✅ Verify session has expired - Console logged "[ActivityTracker] Session timed out due to inactivity"
5. ✅ Verify redirect to login page - Page URL changed to /login
6. ✅ Verify message about session expiration - Yellow warning displayed: "Your session has expired due to inactivity. Please log in again."

**Screenshots:**
- .playwright-mcp/feature9_session_timeout_message.png - Login page with session expiration message

**Technical Details:**

  - Dispatches 'token-refreshed' custom event for other components
- Integrated TokenRefreshManager in App.tsx

**Testing Steps Verified:**
1. ✅ Log in as any user - Logged in as admin/admin123
2. ✅ Wait for token to approach expiration - Used 5000ms test override
3. ✅ Verify refresh token request is made - Console: "[TokenRefreshManager] Initiating token refresh..."
4. ✅ Verify new access token is received - Console: "[TokenRefreshManager] Token refreshed successfully"
   - Initial token: eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsImlhdCI6MTc2ODg0MjAzNDU4MCwiZXhwIjoxNzY4ODQzODM0NTgwfQ==
   - Refreshed token: eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsImlhdCI6MTc2ODg0MjA0NDYwOSwiZXhwIjoxNzY4ODQzODQ0NjA5fQ==
   - tokensAreDifferent: true
5. ✅ Verify session continues without interruption - User remains logged in on dashboard

**Network Verification:**

- Backend logs all refresh events for debugging
- Component handles edge cases: visibility change, concurrent refresh prevention


## Testing Session: 2026-01-19 12:04

[Testing] Feature #8 'User can log out' - REGRESSION FOUND AND FIXED

**Regression Found:**
- CORS configuration was hardcoded to only allow http://localhost:5173
- When port 5173 was in use, Vite started on port 5174
- This caused "Access to fetch... from origin" CORS errors
- Login and logout (all API calls) were failing with ERR_FAILED

**Root Cause:**
- backend/src/index.ts line 13 had: `origin: 'http://localhost:5173'`
- Needed to accept multiple ports for development flexibility

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated CORS middleware to use dynamic origin validation
- Now accepts ports 5173, 5174, 5175 on both localhost and 127.0.0.1
- Still respects FRONTEND_URL environment variable

**Verification Steps Passed:**
1. ✅ Log in as any user - Logged in as admin/admin123
2. ✅ Click user menu in header - Opened dropdown showing user info
3. ✅ Click logout button - Clicked "Sign out" menu item
4. ✅ Verify redirect to login page - URL changed to /login
5. ✅ Verify JWT token is cleared - `token: null` in localStorage
6. ✅ Verify session data is cleared - `currentProgramId: null` in localStorage
7. ✅ Verify cannot access protected routes - /dashboard redirects to /login
8. ✅ No console errors detected

**Commit:** 8392a03 - Fix CORS regression: allow multiple localhost ports

[Testing] Session complete - fixed regression in feature #8

## Session: 2026-01-19 (Agent working on Feature #32)

### Completed This Session:
- Feature #32: Create new asset - VERIFIED AND PASSING

**Implementation:**

**Backend Changes (backend/src/index.ts):**
- Added POST /api/assets endpoint for creating new assets
- Added GET /api/reference/locations endpoint for fetching location data
- Added GET /api/reference/asset-statuses endpoint for fetching status codes
- Fixed critical bug: newly created assets were pushed to `mockAssets` array but GET endpoint was using `generateDetailedAssets()` which returned hardcoded data
- Solution: Now push new assets to `detailedAssets` array which GET endpoint uses
- Added proper validation for required fields, status codes, and locations
- Added duplicate serial number check within same program

**Frontend Changes (frontend/src/pages/AssetsPage.tsx):**
- Added "Add Asset" button (visible to ADMIN and DEPOT_MANAGER roles only)
- Added modal dialog with HeadlessUI Dialog/Transition
- Added form fields:
  - Part Number (required, alphanumeric with dashes/underscores)
  - Serial Number (required)
  - Asset Name (optional, auto-generated if empty)
  - Status (dropdown with FMC, PMC, NMCM, NMCS, CNDM options)
  - Administrative Location (dropdown)
  - Custodial Location (dropdown)
  - Notes (optional)
- Added Zod validation schema for form data
- Added success message display after creation
- Added form reset and modal close on success
- Added fetchReferenceData function to populate dropdowns

**Testing Steps Verified:**
1. ✅ Log in as depot manager or admin - Logged in as admin/admin123
2. ✅ Navigate to Assets page - Navigated to /assets
3. ✅ Click 'Add Asset' button - Button visible and clicked
4. ✅ Fill in part number - PN-TEST-NEW
5. ✅ Fill in serial number - TEST-VERIFY-32
6. ✅ Select status - FMC - Full Mission Capable
7. ✅ Select administrative location - Depot Alpha
8. ✅ Select custodial location - Maintenance Bay 1
9. ✅ Fill in other required fields - Notes: "Created for feature 32 verification"
10. ✅ Click save - Clicked "Create Asset" button
11. ✅ Verify asset appears in list - New asset visible in table at bottom
12. ✅ Verify success message - "Asset "TEST-VERIFY-32" created successfully!"

**Screenshots:**
- .playwright-mcp/feature-32-asset-created.png - Assets page with Add Asset button
- .playwright-mcp/feature-32-new-asset-in-list.png - Newly created asset in list

### Current Status:
- Feature #32 marked as PASSING
- Features Passing: ~32/374

### What Was Built:
- backend/src/index.ts - Added POST /api/assets, GET /api/reference/locations, GET /api/reference/asset-statuses
- frontend/src/pages/AssetsPage.tsx - Added Add Asset button, modal form, and create functionality

### Key Bug Fix:
The original implementation had a bug where:
- POST /api/assets pushed new assets to `mockAssets` array
- GET /api/assets used `generateDetailedAssets()` which returned hardcoded static data
- Result: newly created assets never appeared in the list

Fixed by:
- Changed GET /api/assets to use `detailedAssets` (mutable array initialized once)
- Modified POST /api/assets to also push to `detailedAssets` array
- This ensures newly created assets appear immediately in the list

### Notes:
- Role-based access: Only ADMIN and DEPOT_MANAGER can see the Add Asset button
- Form validation prevents invalid data submission
- All dropdowns populated from backend reference data

## Session: 2026-01-19 (Agent working on Feature #60)

### Completed This Session:
- Feature #60: Configuration search by name - VERIFIED AND PASSING

**Description:** Users can search configurations by name

**Implementation Status:**
The search functionality was already implemented in previous sessions. This session verified the feature works correctly through comprehensive browser automation testing.

**Backend Implementation (already present):**
- GET /api/configurations endpoint supports 'search' query parameter
- Search filters by cfg_name, partno, part_name, and description
- Case-insensitive search implemented

**Frontend Implementation (already present):**
- Search input field with placeholder 'Search by name, P/N, or description...'
- Debounced search with 300ms delay for better performance
- Results update automatically as user types

**Verification Steps Completed:**
1. ✅ Log in as any user - Logged in as admin/admin123
2. ✅ Navigate to Configurations page - Successfully navigated to /configurations with 4 configurations
3. ✅ Enter configuration name in search - Searched for 'Radar'
4. ✅ Verify matching configurations display - Only 'Radar Unit Configuration' shown (1 configuration)
5. ✅ Clear search - Cleared the search input field
6. ✅ Verify all configurations display - All 4 configurations restored

**Additional Tests:**
- Searched for 'Camera' - correctly showed only 'Camera System X Configuration'
- Search is case-insensitive and filters in real-time

**Screenshots:**
- .playwright-mcp/feature60_search_radar_filter.png - Search results for 'Radar' (1 config)
- .playwright-mcp/feature60_search_cleared_all_configs.png - All configs after clearing search

[Testing] Feature #50 'Asset pagination works correctly' - VERIFIED STILL PASSING

**Regression Test Result:** No regression found - feature is correctly implemented.

**Verification Steps Completed:**
1. ✅ Log in as admin - Logged in as admin/admin123
2. ✅ Navigate to Assets page - Successfully navigated to /assets
3. ⚠️ Pagination controls display - N/A (correctly hidden when total_pages=1)
4. ✅ First page shows limited records - Shows 10 records (page size = 10)
5. ⚠️ Click next page - N/A (only 1 page exists with current test data)
6. ⚠️ Next set of records displays - N/A (only 1 page)
7. ⚠️ Click page number - N/A (only 1 page)
8. ⚠️ Correct page displays - N/A (only 1 page)
9. ✅ Total count is accurate - Shows '10 total assets' correctly

**Code Review Confirmed:**
- Frontend (AssetsPage.tsx lines 945-1013): Pagination controls render only when total_pages > 1
- Backend (index.ts lines 2374-2397): Server-side pagination with page, limit, offset, total_pages
- API calls correctly include pagination params: ?page=1&limit=10

**Why No Regression:**
The pagination feature is CORRECTLY implemented. Pagination controls only show when needed (total_pages > 1).
The test data has exactly 10 CRIIS assets with a page size of 10, resulting in 1 page total.
This is expected UX behavior - hiding pagination when unnecessary.

**Additional Verifications:**
- Network requests show API calls with pagination params
- No console errors related to pagination
- Code review confirms proper implementation

**Screenshots:**
- .playwright-mcp/feature50_assets_page_single_page.png - Assets page with 10 assets (1 page)

## Session: 2026-01-19 (Agent working on Feature #64)

### Completed This Session:
- Feature #64: Part relationship validation - VERIFIED AND PASSING

**Description:** System validates part relationships for consistency

**Implementation:**

**Backend (backend/src/index.ts) - Already Present:**
The backend validation was already implemented in previous commits. The validation includes:
1. **VALIDATION 1: Configuration Type Compatibility**
   - COMPONENT type configurations cannot have NHA parent relationships
   - Returns error: "Incompatible part type: COMPONENT configurations cannot have NHA parent relationships"
   
2. **VALIDATION 2: Circular Reference Detection**
   - Checks if proposed parent is already a child of the new part
   - Uses recursive `checkCircularReference()` function to detect cycles
   - Uses `checkAncestors()` function to verify ancestor relationships
   - Returns error: "Circular reference detected: Cannot set X as parent of Y..."

**Frontend (frontend/src/pages/ConfigurationDetailPage.tsx):**
- Updated Zod schema `addBomItemSchema` to include optional `nha_partno_c` field
- Updated `onAddSubmit` to include `nha_partno_c` in API request body
- Added NHA Parent dropdown to Add Part modal with:
  - Lists all existing BOM items as selectable parents
  - "-- No Parent (Top-level part) --" as default option
  - Disabled state for COMPONENT configurations
  - Warning message: "⚠️ NHA parent relationships are not available for COMPONENT configurations"
  - Helper text: "Select an existing BOM part to make this a child (SRA) of that part"

**Verification Steps Completed:**
1. ✅ Log in as depot manager - Logged in as depot_mgr/depot123
2. ✅ Navigate to configuration BOM - Navigated to Configuration #1 (Camera System X - ASSEMBLY)
3. ✅ Attempt to add part that creates circular reference:
   - Entered PN-SENSOR-A with PN-MOUNT-KIT as NHA parent
   - PN-MOUNT-KIT is already a child of PN-SENSOR-A
4. ✅ Verify error message:
   - Error displayed: "Circular reference detected: Cannot set 'PN-MOUNT-KIT' as parent of 'PN-SENSOR-A' because it would create a circular dependency in the assembly hierarchy."
5. ✅ Attempt to add incompatible part type:
   - Navigated to Configuration #4 (Navigation Unit Standard - COMPONENT)
   - NHA Parent dropdown was DISABLED
6. ✅ Verify validation message:
   - Warning displayed: "⚠️ NHA parent relationships are not available for COMPONENT configurations"
7. ✅ Add valid part:
   - Added PN-TEST-VALID-PART without NHA parent to ASSEMBLY configuration
8. ✅ Verify success:
   - BOM count increased from 3 to 4
   - Success message: "Part 'PN-TEST-VALID-PART' added to BOM successfully"
   - (Test data cleaned up after verification)

**Screenshots:**
- .playwright-mcp/feature64_component_nha_disabled.png - COMPONENT config with disabled NHA dropdown
- .playwright-mcp/feature64_circular_reference_error.png - Circular reference error message
- .playwright-mcp/feature64_valid_part_added.png - Valid part successfully added

**Implementation:**

**Backend (backend/src/index.ts):**
- Added `date_from` query parameter for filtering events starting from a specific date
- Added `date_to` query parameter for filtering events up to a specific date
- Date range filter applies to the `start_job` field
- Proper date handling with start-of-day and end-of-day timestamps

**Frontend (frontend/src/pages/MaintenancePage.tsx):**
- Added CalendarIcon and ArrowPathIcon imports
- Added `dateFromFilter` and `dateToFilter` state variables
- Updated fetchEvents to include date range parameters in API call
- Updated useCallback and useEffect dependency arrays
- Reorganized filter UI into two rows:
  - Row 1: Search input + Event Type dropdown
  - Row 2: Date Range picker + PQDR checkbox + Clear All Filters button
- Added Date Range filter with calendar icon and two date inputs (From/To)
- Added Clear All Filters button that appears only when filters are active
- Clear All Filters resets: searchQuery, eventTypeFilter, pqdrFilter, dateFromFilter, dateToFilter

**Verification Steps Completed:**
1. ✅ Log in as any user - Logged in as admin/admin123
2. ✅ Navigate to Maintenance page - Successfully navigated to /maintenance with 4 open events
3. ✅ Search by job number - Searched "MX-2024-001", filtered to 1 matching event
4. ✅ Verify matching events display - Only MX-2024-001 displayed, counts updated (1 Critical, 0 Urgent, 0 Routine)
5. ✅ Filter by date range - Set From: 2026-01-15, To: 2026-01-18
6. ✅ Verify filtered results - 2 events displayed (MX-2024-003 Jan 16, MX-2024-004 Jan 17)
7. ✅ Filter by status (open/closed) - History tab shows 1 closed event (MX-2024-008)
8. ✅ Clear all filters - Button appeared when filters active, clicking it reset all filters
9. ✅ Verify all events display - Back to 4 total events after clearing filters

**Additional Verifications:**
- ✅ Clear All Filters button only appears when at least one filter is active
- ✅ Summary counts update dynamically based on filtered data
- ✅ Tab counts update correctly (Backlog shows open count, History shows closed count)
- ✅ All filters can be combined (search + date range + event type + PQDR)
- ✅ No console errors detected
