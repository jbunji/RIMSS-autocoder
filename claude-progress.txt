**Implementation:**
- Created ProtectedRoute component for guarding authenticated routes
- Created authStore using Zustand with persist middleware for auth state
- Updated App.tsx with React Router routes and redirect logic
- Added DashboardPage placeholder component
- Added Layout component with navbar and sidebar (from parallel agent work)

**Testing Steps Verified:**
1. ✅ Clear all session data and cookies - localStorage.clear(), sessionStorage.clear()
2. ✅ Navigate to homepage URL - http://localhost:5175/
3. ✅ Verify redirect to login page - URL changed from / to /login
4. ✅ Verify login form is displayed - Username, Password fields, Sign In button visible

5. ✅ Verify JWT token is cleared - Token in localStorage changed from JWT string to null
6. ✅ Verify session data is cleared - currentProgramId changed from 1 to null
7. ✅ Verify cannot access protected routes - Navigating to /dashboard and /assets redirects to /login

**localStorage Before Logout:**
```json
{"state":{"token":"eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsImlhdCI6MTc2ODg0MTcxMjM5NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY4ODQzNTEyMzk1fQ==","currentProgramId":1},"version":0}

**Testing Steps Verified:**
1. ✅ Log in as any user - Logged in as admin/admin123
2. ✅ Wait for token to approach expiration - Used 5000ms test override
3. ✅ Verify refresh token request is made - Console: "[TokenRefreshManager] Initiating token refresh..."
4. ✅ Verify new access token is received - Console: "[TokenRefreshManager] Token refreshed successfully"
   - Initial token: eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsImlhdCI6MTc2ODg0MjAzNDU4MCwiZXhwIjoxNzY4ODQzODM0NTgwfQ==
   - Refreshed token: eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsImlhdCI6MTc2ODg0MjA0NDYwOSwiZXhwIjoxNzY4ODQzODQ0NjA5fQ==
