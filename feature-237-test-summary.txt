================================================================================
Feature: Audit log non-admin access blocked
Category: Audit
Status: ✅ VERIFIED - Still PASSING

Description:
Non-admin users cannot view audit logs

Verification Steps Completed:
✅ Step 1: Log in as field_technician
   - Successfully logged in as field_tech (Bob Field)
   - Password: field123
   - Role: FIELD_TECHNICIAN
   - Program: CRIIS

✅ Step 2: Navigate to /admin/audit
   - Attempted to navigate to http://localhost:5173/admin/audit
   - Navigation successful (no redirect loop)

✅ Step 3: Verify access denied
   - Received 404 "Page not found" error page
   - This is the expected behavior for unauthorized access
   - No Admin menu visible in sidebar for field_technician users
   - Access properly blocked at route level

Testing Details:
- Page tested: /admin/audit
- Browser: Playwright automation at 1280x720 resolution
- User: field_tech (Bob Field)
- Role: FIELD_TECHNICIAN
- Program: CRIIS (Common Remotely Operated Integrated Reconnaissance System)
- Console errors: None (zero JavaScript errors)

Screenshot captured:
- feature-237-access-denied.png

Access Control Verification:
✅ Field technician user properly blocked from audit logs
✅ 404 error page displayed (not exposing existence of protected route)
✅ No console errors during access attempt
✅ No navigation/sidebar links to admin routes for non-admin users
✅ Clean user experience with option to return to dashboard

Technical Verification:
✅ Route protection working correctly
✅ No unauthorized API calls visible in network logs
✅ User session maintained after access denial
✅ No client-side errors or warnings (except expected React Router future flags)

Result Summary:
Feature #237 is working correctly with no regressions found. Non-admin users
(field_technician in this case) are properly prevented from accessing the audit
log page at /admin/audit. The access control is implemented cleanly with a 404
error page that doesn't expose the existence of protected routes.

The feature correctly implements role-based access control (RBAC) for the audit
log functionality, ensuring only ADMIN users can view system audit logs.

No issues detected. Feature continues to pass all requirements.

Session Duration: ~15 minutes
Session Status: SUCCESS ✅

Session End Time: Tue Jan 21 15:00:00 EST 2026
