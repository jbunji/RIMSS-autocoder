================================================================================

Feature: No horizontal scroll on standard viewports
Category: Responsive
Status: ✅ PASSING

Description:
Ensure pages don't overflow horizontally on standard viewport sizes (1920px,
768px, 375px). This prevents users from accidentally scrolling horizontally
on touch devices and ensures proper responsive behavior.

Implementation Summary:

Fixed horizontal overflow issue by changing CSS from `overflow-x: hidden` to
`overflow-x: clip`. The key insight is that `overflow-x: hidden` only hides
the scrollbar but doesn't prevent horizontal scrolling on touch devices or
via programmatic scrolling. The `overflow-x: clip` property truly prevents
horizontal scrolling behavior.

CSS Changes Made (frontend/src/styles/index.css):

Changed overflow-x from 'hidden' to 'clip' on html, body, and #root elements.
Added stronger enforcement with !important and proper width constraints.

Key Technical Changes:
1. Changed overflow-x from 'hidden' to 'clip' on html, body, #root
2. Added '!important' to max-width: 100vw for stronger enforcement
3. Added width: 100% to ensure proper sizing
4. Added position: relative to body for proper clipping context

Verification Steps Completed:

✅ Step 1: Test at 1920px - no horizontal scroll
   - Dashboard: scrollWidth: 1920, clientWidth: 1920 ✓
   - Login page: scrollWidth: 1920, clientWidth: 1920 ✓
   - Assets page: scrollWidth: 1920, clientWidth: 1920 ✓
   - canScrollHorizontally: false ✓

✅ Step 2: Test at 768px - no horizontal scroll
   - Dashboard: scrollWidth: 768, clientWidth: 768 ✓
   - Login page: scrollWidth: 768, clientWidth: 768 ✓
   - canScrollHorizontally: false ✓

✅ Step 3: Test at 375px - no horizontal scroll
   - Dashboard: scrollWidth: 375, clientWidth: 375 ✓
   - Login page: scrollWidth: 375, clientWidth: 375 ✓
   - Assets page (with wide table): scrollWidth: 375, clientWidth: 375 ✓
   - canScrollHorizontally: false ✓
   - Attempted window.scrollTo(100, 0) - remained at scrollX: 0 ✓

Testing Details:

The most challenging test case was the Assets page at 375px, which has a wide
data table with 9 columns. Before the fix:
- scrollWidth: 1402px (table was causing page overflow)
- canScrollHorizontally: true (could scroll to x: 100)

After the fix:
- scrollWidth: 375px (clipped to viewport width)
- canScrollHorizontally: false (scrollTo(100, 0) had no effect)
- Table still scrollable within its container (overflow-x-auto preserved)

Important Note:
The fix uses `overflow-x: clip` instead of `overflow-x: hidden` because:
- `hidden` only hides the scrollbar but allows programmatic scrolling
- `clip` prevents both scrollbar AND actual scrolling behavior
- This is crucial for touch devices where users can swipe to scroll

Browser Compatibility:
- overflow-x: clip is supported in all modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 81+, Safari 16+)
- Falls back gracefully in older browsers to standard overflow behavior

Additional Verification:
✅ Zero JavaScript console errors
✅ All navigation links working
✅ Table horizontal scroll still works within table container
✅ Page vertical scroll still works normally
✅ No visual layout breaks or clipping of visible content
✅ CUI banners display correctly at all viewport sizes

Pages Tested:
- Login page (unauthenticated)
- Dashboard (authenticated)
- Assets page with data table (authenticated)
