[COMPLETED] Wed Jan 21 09:30:00 EST 2026 - Feature #380 Implementation Session
================================================================================

Feature: Update Maintenance event forms to use Assigned Base/Current Base terminology

Status: ✅ PASSING (marked passing in features.db)

Note: Changes were already implemented and committed by parallel agent session in
commit 5a0cf35 (Feature #382). This session verified the implementation was correct.

Changes Already Applied:
- Modified frontend/src/pages/MaintenancePage.tsx:
  * Line 2820: "Location" → "Base Location" (create form label)
  * Line 3743: "Location" → "Base Location" (table column header)
  * Line 1387: "Location" → "Base Location" (PDF export header)
  * Line 1463: "Location" → "Base Location" (Excel export header)

- Modified frontend/src/pages/MaintenanceDetailPage.tsx:
  * Line 2711: "Location" → "Base Location" (detail view label)
  * Line 3900: "Location" → "Base Location" (edit form label)

Verification Steps Completed:
✅ 1. Navigate to maintenance event create form - "Base Location" label displayed
✅ 2. Navigate to maintenance event detail view - "Base Location" label displayed
✅ 3. Navigate to maintenance event edit form - "Base Location" label displayed
✅ 4. Table column header shows "BASE LOCATION"
✅ 5. No console errors detected
✅ 6. All forms functional

Rationale:
Changed from generic "Location" to "Base Location" to align with the "Assigned Base/
Current Base" terminology established in features #375 and #377. The location field
is auto-filled from the asset's admin_loc (Assigned Base), so this clarifies what
type of location it represents - the base where maintenance is performed.

Testing Details:
- Tested create form with various assets - "Base Location" label present
- Tested detail view for multiple maintenance events - "Base Location" displayed
- Tested edit form - "Base Location" label present and functional
- Tested table view - "BASE LOCATION" column header visible
- No JavaScript errors in console
- All forms remain functional with updated labels
