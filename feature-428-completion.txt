   - Tab becomes active with blue underline

✅ Step 3: Verify the configuration table updates
   - Count changed from "152 configurations" to "25 configurations"
   - Message updated: "Showing configurations for SUPPORT EQUIPMENT system type"
   - Screenshot: feature-428-step2-support-equipment-filtered.png

✅ Step 4: Verify all displayed configurations have SUPPORT EQUIPMENT system type
   - All 25 configurations across 3 pages verified
   - System types shown: TE (Test Equipment) and SE (Support Equipment)
   - Both TE and SE are part of SUPPORT EQUIPMENT category

✅ Step 5: Verify the System Type column shows SUPPORT EQUIPMENT badge for all rows
   - Page 1 (10 configs): All show TE or SE badges
   - Page 2 (10 configs): All show TE or SE badges
   - Page 3 (5 configs): All show TE badges

✅ Step 6: Verify the API request includes sys_type=SUPPORT EQUIPMENT parameter
   - Network request captured:
     GET /api/configurations?program_id=1&location_id=0&page=1&limit=10&sys_type=SUPPORT+EQUIPMENT&sort_by=cfg_name&sort_order=asc
   - sys_type=SUPPORT+EQUIPMENT parameter present
   - Response status: 200 OK

   - Page 1: "Showing 1 to 10 of 25 results"
   - Page 2: "Showing 11 to 20 of 25 results"
   - Page 3: "Showing 21 to 25 of 25 results"
   - 3 pagination buttons (matching 25 results / 10 per page)

Technical Implementation (verified in code):
