================================================================================

Feature: Resolve part numbers to readable names
Category: data
Status: PASSING

Description:
Part number IDs in cfg_set.partno_id and cfg_list (partno_p, partno_c) should be
resolved to actual part numbers and names from the part_list table.

Implementation (Already Existed):
The feature was already fully implemented in both backend and frontend:

Backend (backend/src/index.ts):
- Line 14641-14662: GET /api/configurations includes part relation with partno, noun
- Line 14677-14678: Returns partno and part_name (noun) in configuration list response
- Line 14786-14869: GET /api/configurations/:id/bom endpoint
  - Lines 14824-14831: Includes parentPart and childPart relations
  - Lines 14836-14852: Returns parent_partno, parent_noun, child_partno, child_noun

Frontend (frontend/src/pages/ConfigurationsPage.tsx):
- Lines 72-73: Configuration interface has partno and part_name fields
- Lines 1141-1145: Displays partno with part_name below in table

Frontend (frontend/src/pages/ConfigurationDetailPage.tsx):
- Lines 74-93: BOMItem interface has parent_partno, parent_noun, child_partno, child_noun
- Lines 1436-1451: BOM table displays resolved part numbers and names

Verification Results:

Step 1: View configuration list - verify base part number shows readable part number, not just ID
- A10 AVIONICS: Shows "-" (no partno_id, correctly shows dash)
- ACT II: Shows "AD44012-2" with "ACT II" below (resolved from partno_id)
- ADTS: Shows "S9-500-50" with "ADTS" below (resolved from partno_id)

Step 2: View configuration detail - verify BOM items show part numbers and nouns
- Viewed A10 AVIONICS configuration (cfg_set_id=50) with 6 BOM items
- All child parts display part numbers: 091300-302, 091020-301, 816190-807, etc.
- All child names display nouns: VIBRATION CCA A5, CABLE ASSEMBLY, SWITCHING UNIT
- Parent parts display resolved numbers: 200222868-30 (IMPROVED ELECTRONIC PROCESSOR UNIT)

Step 3: Test configurations with and without a base partno_id
- A10 AVIONICS: No base partno_id -> shows "-" in list, "N/A" in detail
- ACT II: Has base partno_id -> shows "AD44012-2" and "ACT II"
- Both cases handled correctly

Step 4: Verify part lookups work for both parent (partno_p) and child (partno_c) parts
- Child parts resolved correctly:
  * partno_c ID 12446 -> partno "091300-302", noun "VIBRATION CCA A5"
  * partno_c ID 12445 -> partno "091020-301", noun "CABLE ASSEMBLY,SPECIAL PURPOSE,E"
- Parent parts resolved correctly:
  * partno_p ID 10091 -> partno "200222868-30", noun "IMPROVED ELECTRONIC PROCESSOR UNIT (IEPU)"
  * partno_p ID 10015 -> partno "726801-807", noun "UHF R/T"

Technical Quality:
- Zero critical console errors
- Minor 404s on software/meters tabs (separate features)
- All API calls for part resolution successful
- UI rendering correct
- Data properly loaded from cfg_list and part_list tables

Screenshots Captured:

2. feature-436-bom-part-numbers-resolved.png - BOM tab header
3. feature-436-bom-table-resolved-part-numbers.png - BOM table with parent/child part resolution

Project Progress:
- Before: 427/449 features passing (95.1%)
- After:  428/449 features passing (95.3%)

Session Status: SUCCESS
Session Duration: ~10 minutes
Session End Time: Wed Jan 21 22:58:00 EST 2026
Execution Mode: Single Feature Mode (Parallel Execution)

Notes:
- Feature #436 was already fully implemented
- This session verified the existing implementation works correctly
- All 4 verification steps passed successfully
- Part number resolution works for both configuration list and BOM items
- Both parent (partno_p) and child (partno_c) parts are resolved correctly
