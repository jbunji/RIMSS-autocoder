================================================================================

Feature: Display configuration hierarchy in detail view
Category: style
Status: PASSING

Description:
The configuration detail page should display the BOM items in a hierarchical
tree structure showing parent-child relationships between parts.

Verification Steps Completed:

Step 1: Navigate to a configuration detail page - PASSED
   - Navigated to CRIIS_POD_L configuration (ID: 89)
   - Verified page loads correctly with all tabs

Step 2: Verify BOM items are displayed in a hierarchical/tree format - PASSED
   - Hierarchy tab shows proper tree structure
   - Tree nodes collapsible/expandable with chevron icons
   - Visual legend shows Root Configuration, Assembly (NHA), and Component

Step 3: Verify parent parts are shown with their child components indented below - PASSED
   - Parent parts (NHA assemblies) have children indented below them
   - Example: 987-1404-211 (RAIL, MOUNTING) is NHA with many children
   - Multiple levels of nesting: Root to Level 1 to Level 2 to Level 3

Step 4: Verify quantity per assembly (QPA) is displayed for each item - PASSED
   - QPA column visible in BOM tab table
   - Hierarchy view shows blue quantity badge for items with QPA greater than 1
   - Code verified: displays "x{qpa}" badge when qpa > 1

Step 5: Verify sort order is respected within hierarchy levels - PASSED
   - sortChildren() function at lines 904-919 sorts by sort_order
   - Children sorted at each level of the hierarchy

Step 6: Test configurations with nested hierarchies - PASSED
   - Tested CRIIS_POD_L: 34 BOM items, 7 NHA assemblies
   - Multi-level nesting verified
   - Hierarchy summary: Total Parts: 34, NHA Assemblies: 7, Child Parts: 28

Implementation Details:
- Frontend: ConfigurationDetailPage.tsx has Hierarchy tab
- TreeNode interface for hierarchy visualization
- buildHierarchyTree() constructs tree from BOM items
- TreeNodeComponent renders recursive tree nodes
- expandAll() / collapseAll() / toggleNode() for interactivity
- sortChildren() for sort order within levels

Technical Quality:
- Zero console errors related to hierarchy feature
- Proper visual indentation and icons
- Expand/Collapse functionality works
- Summary statistics accurate
- Circular reference detection handled gracefully

Project Progress: 435/449 features passing (96.9%)
Session Status: SUCCESS
Session Duration: ~20 minutes
Session Mode: Single Feature Mode (Feature #443 assigned)

Note: Feature #443 hierarchy implementation was already complete. This session
verified all requirements through comprehensive browser testing.
