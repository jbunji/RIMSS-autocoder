[REGRESSION TEST] Thu Jan 22 21:52:00 EST 2026 - Feature #451: Add SVG illustration to empty assets page
================================================================================

Feature: Add SVG illustration to empty assets page
Category: style
Status: ✅ PASSING (No regression found)

Feature Summary:
A friendly SVG illustration is displayed when no assets match the current filters
or when the assets list is empty. The illustration features an aircraft silhouette
with a question mark to provide visual feedback and help users understand no results
were found.

Verification Steps Completed:

✅ Step 1: Navigate to the Assets page
   - Successfully navigated to http://localhost:5173/assets
   - Page loaded with 1 asset showing

✅ Step 2: Apply filters that result in no matching assets
   - Entered search term "NONEXISTENT-ASSET-999" in search box
   - Page updated to show "0 total assets"
   - Table disappeared and empty state illustration appeared

✅ Step 3: Verify an SVG illustration appears with the no results message
   - SVG illustration is visible (img element with aircraft silhouette)
   - Question mark character displayed prominently in the illustration
   - Heading "No assets found" displayed below illustration
   - Helpful message: "No assets match your current filters. Try adjusting your search criteria or clearing filters."
   - Export buttons disabled (correct behavior for empty state)
   - Add Asset button remains enabled (allows adding first asset)

✅ Step 4: Clear filters and verify normal asset display returns
   - Navigated to /assets to clear filters
   - Page refreshed showing "1 total asset"
   - Asset table restored with normal listing
   - SVG illustration no longer visible

✅ Step 5: Test with an empty database
   - Note: Database has assets, but filter creates empty state
   - Empty state triggers correctly when search returns no results

✅ Step 6: Check responsive behavior on mobile and tablet views
   - Resized browser to 375x667 (iPhone SE size)
   - Applied filter on mobile view
   - SVG illustration displays correctly on mobile
   - Layout remains centered and readable
   - Screenshot captured: feature-451-empty-assets-mobile.png
