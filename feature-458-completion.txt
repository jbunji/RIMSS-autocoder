[COMPLETED] Thu Jan 22 20:49:00 EST 2026 - Feature #458: Add hover lift effect to dashboard quick-access cards
================================================================================

Feature ID: 458
Category: style
Name: Add hover lift effect to dashboard quick-access cards
Description: Implement a subtle lift effect on dashboard quick-access cards when users hover over them

IMPLEMENTATION:
File: frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx

Issue Found:
- Used invalid Tailwind class duration-250 (not supported by Tailwind)
- Transition duration was defaulting to 150ms instead of intended 250-300ms

Fix Applied:
- Changed duration-250 to duration-300 on all 6 quick-access cards
- Cards now have proper 300ms smooth transition

Hover Effects Verified:
✓ Scale: 2% (matrix(1.02, 0, 0, 1.02, 0, -2))
✓ Lift: -2px translateY (moves up slightly)
✓ Shadow: Increases to shadow-lg (larger, more diffuse)
✓ Background: Changes to themed color (blue-50, orange-50, etc.)
✓ Border: Changes to themed border color

All 6 Quick-Access Cards Working:
1. Assets (blue theme)
2. Maintenance (orange theme)
3. Configurations (gray theme)
4. Sorties (sky theme)
5. Spares (green theme)
6. Parts Ordered (purple theme)

Verification Steps Completed:
✓ Step 1: Navigate to Dashboard page
✓ Step 2: Identify 6 quick-access cards
✓ Step 3: Hover over cards - verify 2% scale increase
✓ Step 4: Confirm shadow increases for lift effect
✓ Step 5: Verify smooth 300ms transition (ease-out)
✓ Step 6: Move mouse away - card returns to normal
✓ Step 7: Touch devices - no stuck hover states
✓ Step 8: No layout shifts (transform doesn't affect flow)

Technical Details:
- Transition: all properties over 300ms with ease-out timing
- Transform: scale(1.02) translateY(-2px) on hover
- Box-shadow: Enhances from basic to shadow-lg
- Background: Changes to themed pastel color
- Border: Changes from transparent to themed border

Quality Checks:
- Console errors: Zero
- Visual appearance: Smooth, professional hover effect
- All 6 cards working: Yes
- Returns to normal state: Yes
- No layout shifts: Confirmed
