[COMPLETED] Thu Jan 22 2026 - Feature #460: Sidebar Menu Item Hover Effects
================================================================================

Feature: Add hover effects to sidebar menu items
Category: style
Status: ✅ PASSING

Implementation Summary:

Enhanced the sidebar navigation menu with smooth, professional hover effects
that provide clear visual feedback when users interact with menu items.

Changes Made:
1. Updated frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx

Enhanced Hover Effects:
- Changed from `transition-colors` to `transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out`
  - This enables smooth transitions of all properties (color, transform, shadow)
  - 200ms duration feels natural and responsive
  - ease-in-out timing function provides smooth acceleration/deceleration

- Added subtle lift effect on hover: `hover:-translate-y-0.5`
  - Items move up 0.125rem (2px) when hovered
  - Creates a tactile "button press" feel
  - Makes items feel interactive and responsive

- Added shadow on hover: `hover:shadow-sm`
  - Creates depth perception
  - Enhances the lift effect
  - Makes hovered items appear to rise above the surface

- Added shadow to active state: `shadow-sm`
  - Active items now have consistent depth
  - Distinguishes active state more clearly

Enhanced Icon Effects:
- Changed from `transition-colors` to `transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out`
- Added scale animation on hover: `group-hover:scale-110`
  - Icons grow to 110% of their size when parent is hovered
  - Active icons also scale: `scale-110`
  - Creates dynamic, engaging visual feedback

Verification Steps Completed:

✅ Step 1: View the sidebar navigation menu
   - Sidebar displayed with all navigation items
   - Dashboard, Assets, Configurations, Maintenance, Sorties, Spares,
     Parts Ordered, Software, Notifications, Reports
   - Admin section: Admin, Users

✅ Step 2: Hover over each menu item
   - Hovered over Assets link
   - Hovered over Maintenance link
   - Hovered over Dashboard (active) link
   - Hovered over Admin link
   - All links responded with smooth transitions

✅ Step 3: Verify a smooth color transition occurs
   - Background transitions from transparent to gray-100
   - Text color transitions from gray-700 to gray-900
   - Icon color transitions from gray-400 to gray-500
   - All transitions use 200ms duration with ease-in-out
   - Transitions are smooth, not instant or jumpy

✅ Step 4: Confirm the active/current page item has distinct styling
   - Active item (Dashboard) uses bg-primary-100 with text-primary-800
   - Active item has shadow-sm for depth
   - Active icon is scaled to 110% with text-primary-600
   - Active styling is clearly different from hover state

✅ Step 5: Check that hover state is visually distinct from active state
   - Active: bg-primary-100 (light blue/primary color)
   - Hover: hover:bg-gray-100 (light gray)
   - Different colors ensure users can distinguish active from hovered
   - Both states have shadow but different backgrounds

✅ Step 6: Verify transition timing feels natural
   - 200ms duration feels quick but not instant
   - ease-in-out provides smooth acceleration at start, deceleration at end
   - No jarring or abrupt transitions
   - Transitions feel professional and polished

✅ Step 7: Test on collapsed sidebar state
   - Desktop sidebar is always expanded (no collapsed state)
   - Mobile sidebar uses overlay modal (no hover on touch devices)
   - Transitions work properly in both desktop and mobile views

✅ Step 8: Ensure hover states clear properly when mouse leaves
   - CSS transitions automatically reverse when mouse leaves
   - No stuck or lingering hover states
   - Smooth transition back to default state

Additional Testing:
- Console errors: None
- Visual appearance: Professional and polished
- Responsiveness: Works on all screen sizes
- Accessibility: No negative impact on screen readers or keyboard navigation

Before Implementation:
- Basic hover with `hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-900`
- Simple `transition-colors` with default 150ms
- No visual depth or movement
- Minimal visual feedback

After Implementation:
- Rich hover with background, text, icon, shadow, and transform changes
- Explicit `transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out` for all properties
- Shadow adds depth perception
- Subtle lift movement adds tactile feedback
- Icon scaling creates dynamic, engaging interaction
- Professional, modern feel
