================================================================================
Feature: Add smooth page transition animations
Category: style
Status: ✅ PASSING

Implementation Summary:
Implemented smooth fade-in animations for page transitions throughout the application.
When users navigate between pages, content gracefully fades in with a subtle slide-up effect,
providing a polished feel that helps users understand they have navigated to new content.

Implementation Details:
1. Created PageTransition component (frontend/src/components/PageTransition.tsx):
   - Wraps page content and triggers animation on route changes
   - Uses React's useLocation hook to detect navigation
   - Force reflow technique ensures animation replays on each navigation

2. Added CSS animations (frontend/src/styles/index.css):
   - Keyframe animation: pageFadeIn
   - Duration: 250ms with ease-out timing function
   - Effects: opacity 0→1 and translateY 8px→0
   - Smooth, natural motion that doesn't impede workflow

3. Updated Layout.tsx:
   - Imported and applied PageTransition wrapper around Outlet
   - All page routes now have consistent transition effects

Verification Steps Completed:

✅ Step 1: Navigate between different pages using the sidebar
   - Tested: Dashboard → Assets → Configurations → Maintenance → Dashboard
   - All navigation triggers transition animation

✅ Step 2: Observe the page content transition animation
   - Fade-in effect visible on all page changes
   - Subtle slide-up motion (8px) adds depth
   - Content appears naturally, not instant

✅ Step 3: Verify content fades in smoothly (not instant appearance)
   - Opacity transition from 0 to 1 over 250ms
   - Smooth easing with ease-out function
   - No abrupt or jarring appearance

✅ Step 4: Confirm transition duration feels natural (not too slow)
   - 250ms duration is quick but noticeable
   - Within 200-300ms requirement range
   - Doesn't impede user workflow

✅ Step 5: Check that transitions do not block user interaction
   - Users can click and interact immediately
   - No waiting for animation to complete
   - Rapid navigation works smoothly

✅ Step 6: Test rapid navigation between pages
   - Clicked quickly through multiple pages
   - No flickering or layout shifts
   - Animations complete cleanly even with rapid clicks

✅ Step 7: Verify back button navigation also has transitions
   - Tested browser back button
   - Back navigation triggers fade-in animation
   - Consistent behavior with forward navigation

✅ Step 8: Ensure no content flashing or layout shifts during transitions
   - No white flashes between pages
   - Layout remains stable during transitions
   - Content appears smoothly without jumping

Quality Checks:
- Console errors: Zero JavaScript errors (only expected React DevTools warnings)
- Visual appearance: Professional and polished
- Transition timing: 250ms with ease-out (smooth and natural)
- User interaction: Not blocked during transitions
- Back button: Transitions work correctly
- Rapid navigation: No flickering or layout shifts
- Consistency: All pages have same transition effect
- Performance: CSS-based animations, no performance impact
