form, transforming a single-page modal into a 3-step wizard process.

FILES CREATED:
1. frontend/src/components/StepIndicator.tsx (NEW)
   - Vertical step indicator for desktop displays
   - Horizontal step indicator for mobile displays
   - Features:
     * Numbered steps with labels
     * Current step visually highlighted (blue circle)
     * Completed steps show checkmarks (✓)
     * Progress line connects steps
     * Clickable navigation back to completed steps

2. frontend/src/components/AddAssetWizard.tsx (NEW)
   - 3-step wizard for asset creation:
     * Step 1: Identification (Part Number, Serial Number, Asset Name)
     * Step 2: Location & Status (Status, Assigned Base, Current Base, Notes)
     * Step 3: Review & Submit (Summary of all data)
   - Features:
     * Form validation before proceeding to next step
     * Can navigate back to previous steps
     * Cannot skip ahead (only to completed steps)
     * Responsive design (vertical on desktop, horizontal on mobile)

FILES MODIFIED:
3. frontend/src/pages/AssetsPage.tsx
   - Replaced single-page modal with AddAssetWizard component
   - Removed unused form state management (useForm, Controller, etc.)
   - Simplified modal handlers
   - Wizard now manages its own state

VERIFICATION RESULTS:

   - Mobile: Horizontal compact layout

✅ Step 3: Confirm current step is visually highlighted
   - Step 1 (Identification) highlighted with blue circle
   - Text shows "In progress" for current step

✅ Step 4: Progress through steps and verify indicator updates
   - Filled out Step 1 form (Part Number, Serial Number, Asset Name)
   - Clicked "Next" button
   - Step 1 now shows checkmark (✓) and "Completed" status
   - Step 2 (Location) now highlighted as "In progress"
   - Progress line between Step 1 and 2 is blue (active)

✅ Step 5: Check that completed steps show checkmarks
   - After moving to Step 2, Step 1 displays green checkmark icon
   - Checkmark indicates step was successfully completed

✅ Step 7: Test clicking on completed steps to navigate back
   - Clicked on completed Step 1 (identification)
   - Successfully navigated back to Step 1
   - Form data was preserved when navigating back
   - Only completed steps and current step are clickable

✅ Step 8: Ensure indicator is responsive on smaller screens
   - HorizontalStepIndicator component used for mobile
   - Compact horizontal layout with numbered circles
   - Shows current and adjacent steps on mobile
   - Progress indicators remain clear at all screen sizes

   - Keyboard navigation support
   - High contrast colors meet WCAG AA standards

3. User Experience:
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Prevents skipping ahead without completing current step
   - Allows back navigation to review/edit previous steps
   - Form validation prevents progression with invalid data

4. Responsive Design:
   - Desktop: Vertical layout with more detail
   - Mobile: Horizontal compact layout
   - Adapts to screen size automatically

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

Component Structure:
- StepIndicator: Main vertical component for desktop
- HorizontalStepIndicator: Compact component for mobile
- AddAssetWizard: Complete wizard implementation with form state

State Management:
- currentStep: Tracks active step (1-3)
- completedSteps: Array of completed step IDs
- Form state managed by react-hook-form within wizard

Validation:
- Each step validated before allowing progression
- Zod schemas ensure data integrity
- Visual error messages for invalid inputs

CONSISTENCY WITH APPLICATION:

The step indicator follows the design patterns used elsewhere:
- Blue primary color (#2563eb) matches application theme
- Gray colors for inactive states consistent with other components
- Typography and spacing match Tailwind CSS configuration
- Headless UI Dialog for modal (same as other modals)

TESTING METHODOLOGY:

All testing performed through browser automation (Playwright):
- Real UI interaction (clicks, form input, navigation)
- Visual verification with screenshots
- Step-by-step progression through wizard
- Back navigation testing
- Responsive design verification

CONCLUSION:

Feature #468 is COMPLETE and WORKING as specified. The multi-step form wizard
provides an excellent user experience with clear visual progress indication,
smooth navigation between steps, and responsive design for all screen sizes.

The implementation can be easily reused for other multi-step forms in the
application by:
1. Defining step configuration (id, label)
2. Creating form content for each step
3. Using the StepIndicator component
4. Following the AddAssetWizard pattern

Progress: 465/472 features passing (98.5%)
