Feature #174: Create notification (admin) - VERIFIED AS WORKING

Summary:
Feature #174 was already fully implemented as part of Feature #173. The backend
POST /api/notifications endpoint and frontend "Add Notification" modal were
created in that earlier feature as a "bonus feature". This session verified
that the implementation works correctly.
