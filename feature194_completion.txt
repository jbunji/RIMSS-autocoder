Feature #194: API returns 403 for unauthorized role access - VERIFIED AND PASSING

Summary:
Successfully verified that the RIMSS backend API properly enforces role-based
access control (RBAC) by returning HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status codes when users
attempt to access endpoints beyond their authorization level.

Test Execution - All 8 Steps PASSED:

✅ Step 1: Log in as viewer
✅ Step 2: Call POST /api/assets as viewer - 403 Forbidden
✅ Step 3: Verify 403 response (viewers cannot create)
✅ Step 4: Log in as field technician
✅ Step 5: Call DELETE /api/users/1 as field tech - 403 Forbidden
✅ Step 6: Verify 403 response (not admin)
✅ Step 7: Call GET /api/audit-logs as field tech - 403 Forbidden
✅ Step 8: Verify 403 response (admin only)

Implementation:
- Added GET /api/audit-logs endpoint (admin-only)
- Verified existing role checks on POST /api/assets
- Verified existing role checks on DELETE /api/users/:id
- All endpoints properly return 403 for unauthorized access

Test Methods:
1. Automated API testing (test_f194.js)
2. Browser verification (zero console errors)
3. Screenshots captured for evidence
