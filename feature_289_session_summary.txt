FEATURE #289 SESSION SUMMARY - PARALLEL EXECUTION MODE
================================================================================

Feature: Reset button clears to defaults not empty
Category: defaults
Status: PASSING ✅

ASSIGNMENT:
This session was run in SINGLE FEATURE MODE as part of parallel execution.
Feature #289 was pre-assigned at session start.

FEATURE REQUIREMENT:
Form reset restores defaults. When a form has a Reset button, clicking it
should restore the form's default values rather than just clearing all fields
to empty/blank state.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:
✅ Added Reset button to Assets form (AssetsPage.tsx)
✅ Button positioned between Cancel and Create Asset
✅ Calls reset() from react-hook-form
✅ Restores configured defaultValues:
   - Status: FMC (Full Mission Capable)
   - Administrative Location: Depot Alpha
   - Custodial Location: Maintenance Bay 1

KEY INSIGHT:
The feature distinguishes between "clearing to empty" vs "restoring defaults":
- WRONG: Reset clears dropdowns to "Select..." (no selection)
- RIGHT: Reset restores dropdowns to meaningful defaults (FMC, Depot Alpha, etc.)

This is important for UX - users get sensible defaults, not empty forms.

TESTING APPROACH:
1. Opened Add Asset form (showed initial defaults)
2. Changed all fields (text inputs and dropdowns)
3. Clicked Reset button
4. Verified defaults were restored (not just cleared)
5. Confirmed dropdowns show selections, not empty state

>
  Reset
</button>
```

QUALITY METRICS:
✅ Zero JavaScript errors
✅ Zero console errors (only expected React Router warnings)
✅ Instant response time
✅ Professional UI matching existing patterns
✅ Works with form validation system
✅ All 7 test steps passed

RESULTS:
- Feature #289: Marked as PASSING
- Progress: 289/374 features passing (77.3%)
- Git Commit: deeb143
- Session Duration: ~30 minutes

USER IMPACT:
Users can now quickly reset forms to sensible defaults with one click,
improving data entry workflow for common cases (FMC assets at depot locations).

SESSION TYPE: Parallel Single-Feature Mode
EXECUTION: Successful ✅
NO ISSUES OR BLOCKERS
