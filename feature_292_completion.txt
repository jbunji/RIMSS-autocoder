Feature #292: Sorting resets when changing views - VERIFIED AND PASSING ✅

Assignment: PARALLEL SESSION - Pre-assigned feature #292
Session Type: Single-feature verification mode

FEATURE DESCRIPTION:
Sort order resets appropriately. When users sort a table by clicking column
headers, then navigate away and return, the sort order should reset to the
default sort order rather than preserving the user's custom sort.

TEST EXECUTION - All 5 Steps PASSED:

✅ Step 1: Log in as any user
   - Logged in as admin user successfully
   - Username: admin, Password: admin123
   - Redirected to dashboard after login

✅ Step 2: Sort by specific column
   - Navigated to Assets page
   - Table displayed with default sort (Serial Number ascending)
   - Initial order: CRIIS-001, CRIIS-002, CRIIS-003, ..., CRIIS-010
   - Clicked "Status" column header to sort
   - Table re-sorted by Status alphabetically
   - New order: CNDM first, then FMC (multiple), NMCM, NMCS, PMC

✅ Step 3: Navigate away
   - Clicked Dashboard navigation link
   - Successfully navigated to dashboard page
   - Left Assets page with Status sorting active

✅ Step 4: Return to list
   - Clicked Assets navigation link
   - Returned to Assets page
   - Table reloaded with fresh data

✅ Step 5: Verify default sort order
   - Sort order RESET to default ✅
   - Table now sorted by Serial Number (ascending)
   - Order: CRIIS-001, CRIIS-002, CRIIS-003, ..., CRIIS-010
   - NOT sorted by Status anymore
   - Confirms sort state does NOT persist across navigation

BEHAVIOR VERIFIED:
The application correctly resets sorting when users navigate away and return.
This is the expected behavior for most applications:
- PRESERVED: User stays on same page, sort persists during pagination/filtering
- RESET: User navigates away, sort returns to default on return

This prevents confusion when users return to a page and see an unexpected
sort order they may have forgotten about.

IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS:
The sorting is likely managed in component state (React state) rather than
URL parameters or session storage. When the component unmounts (navigation
away), the sort state is lost. When the component remounts (return), it
initializes with default sort order.

Alternative behavior (persistence) would require:
- URL query parameters: ?sortBy=status&sortDir=asc
- Session storage: localStorage.setItem('assetSort', {...})
- Application state management: Zustand/Redux global store

Current behavior (reset) is appropriate for most use cases and matches
common web application patterns.

QUALITY VERIFICATION:

✅ Console Output:
   - Zero JavaScript errors
   - Only expected warnings (React Router future flags)
   - No sorting-related errors

✅ Visual Behavior:
   - Sort icons update correctly when clicked
   - Table re-renders smoothly without flashing
   - Data order changes correctly
   - Sort state resets as expected on navigation

✅ User Experience:
   - Sorting is intuitive (click column header)
   - Reset behavior prevents confusion
   - Default sort (Serial Number) is logical
   - Professional appearance maintained

✅ Code Quality:
   - No modifications needed - existing behavior is correct
   - Feature is working as designed
   - Test confirms expected behavior

SCREENSHOTS CAPTURED:
1. feature_292_step2_sorted_by_status.png - Table sorted by Status column
2. feature_292_step5_sorting_reset_to_default.png - Sort reset to default

PAGES TESTED:
- Assets page: Has sortable columns, verified sorting behavior
- Sorties page: Checked (no sortable columns)
- Maintenance page: Checked (no sortable columns)

Result: Feature #292 marked as PASSING ✅
Progress: 290/374 features passing (77.5%)

Session Type: PARALLEL SESSION - Single Feature Mode
Session Duration: ~8 minutes
Testing Method: Full end-to-end browser automation
Quality: Existing sorting behavior works correctly ✅

Git Commit: 468f0fc

Feature Status: PASSING ✅
Sorting Behavior: Working correctly ✅
Default Sort: Serial Number ascending ✅
Reset on Navigation: Confirmed ✅
Code Quality: No changes needed ✅

NO ISSUES FOUND - Sorting resets appropriately when navigating away and
returning to list views. This is the expected and appropriate behavior for
maintaining consistent user experience.
