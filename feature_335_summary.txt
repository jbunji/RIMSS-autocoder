FEATURE #335 - VERIFICATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

Feature ID: 335
Category: concurrency
Name: API response after navigation - no crash
Description: Late responses don't affect current view
Status: ✅ PASSING (Verified on 2026-01-20)

SUMMARY:
--------
Successfully verified that the RIMSS application handles race conditions where
API responses arrive after the user has navigated away from a page. The
application does not crash and the current view remains unaffected by late
API responses.

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------
1. React Query (TanStack Query) automatically handles request cancellation
2. Late API responses are gracefully ignored when components unmount
3. Zero console errors during rapid navigation testing
4. All pages display correct data without corruption
5. Production-ready implementation with proper cleanup

VERIFICATION METHOD:
-------------------
- Full end-to-end browser automation testing
- Rapid navigation between multiple pages (6+ pages)
- Created race conditions with overlapping API calls
- Verified zero errors in console logs
- Confirmed all pages render correctly with proper data

SCREENSHOTS:
-----------
- feature_335_step1_dashboard.png (Initial state)
- feature_335_step2_rapid_navigation_complete.png (After rapid navigation)
- feature_335_step3_final_verification.png (Final verification)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
-----------------
- Uses React Query for API state management
- Automatic request cancellation on component unmount
- Race condition prevention (only latest query updates state)
- Stale data management prevents old data from updating UI
- Clean error boundaries throughout application

RESULT: ✅ PASSING
Progress: 335/374 features passing (89.6%)
Quality: Production-ready
