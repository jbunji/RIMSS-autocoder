This is a test file for Feature #305 - Progress indicator for long operations.

This file is being uploaded to verify that:
1. Progress indicator appears during upload
2. Progress percentage is displayed
3. Progress bar updates during upload
4. Completion is indicated when upload finishes

Test timestamp: 2026-01-20 09:01:00
Feature: #305
Category: feedback
Description: File uploads show progress

The progress indicator should:
- Show a progress bar
- Display percentage (e.g., "Uploading... 45%")
- Update smoothly during the upload process
- Show completion when done

This test file contains enough text to make the upload take a measurable amount of time, allowing us to observe the progress indicator in action. The upload handler in MaintenanceDetailPage.tsx uses a simulated progress mechanism that increments by 10% every 100ms up to 90%, then completes at 100% when the API call finishes.
