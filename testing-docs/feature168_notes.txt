Feature #168: Software catalog list page - IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED

Implementation Summary:
Created a comprehensive software catalog list page that displays all software
versions with search, filtering, and sorting capabilities.

Frontend Implementation (frontend/src/pages/SoftwarePage.tsx):
- Created new SoftwarePage component (337 lines)
- Software interface matching backend structure:
  * sw_id, sw_number, sw_title, sw_type, sys_id
  * revision, revision_date, eff_date
  * cpin_flag (boolean), sw_desc, pgm_id, active
  * program_cd, program_name (from API join)
- State management:
  * software array, loading, error states
  * searchTerm for text filtering
  * sortField and sortDirection for column sorting
  * typeFilter for software type filtering
- Search functionality:
  * Filters by sw_number, sw_title, revision, sw_desc
  * Case-insensitive search
  * Real-time filtering as user types
- Type filter dropdown:
  * Options: All Types, APPLICATION, DSP, FIRMWARE
  * Triggers API call with type parameter
- Sortable table columns:
  * All columns clickable for sorting
  * Visual indicators (up/down/neutral chevron icons)
  * Supports: sw_number, sw_title, sw_type, revision, revision_date, eff_date
  * Date fields sorted numerically by timestamp
- Table display (8 columns):
  * Software Number (font-medium)
  * Title (with description truncated below)
  * Type (color-coded badge: blue for all types)
  * Version (font-medium)
  * Revision Date (formatted MMM DD, YYYY)
  * Effective Date (formatted MMM DD, YYYY)
  * CPIN (Yes or —)
  * Program (pgm_cd)
- Loading state with spinner
- Empty state when no results
- Results count display

Routing Updates (frontend/src/App.tsx):
- Imported SoftwarePage component
- Added route: /software → <SoftwarePage />
- Route positioned between /parts-ordered and /notifications

Navigation Updates (frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx):
- Imported CodeBracketIcon from heroicons
- Added Software link to navigation array:
  * Name: "Software"
  * Href: "/software"
  * Icon: CodeBracketIcon (</> symbol)
  * Positioned between "Parts Ordered" and "Notifications"

Backend API (already implemented):
- GET /api/software endpoint (line 10685)
- Program-based filtering (respects user's assigned programs)
- Optional query parameters: program_id, search, type
- Returns software array with program info joined
- Sorts by revision_date descending

All 4 verification steps completed successfully:

✅ Step 1: Logged in as admin user (John Admin)
✅ Step 2: Navigated to Software page via sidebar link
✅ Step 3: Verified software table displays
   - Table shows 10 software versions
   - All 8 columns displayed correctly
   - Professional layout with proper spacing
✅ Step 4: Verified data loads
   - 10 software versions loaded from backend
   - Data fields properly populated:
     * Software numbers (SW-CAM-CTRL-001, etc.)
     * Titles and descriptions
     * Types (APPLICATION, DSP, FIRMWARE)
     * Versions (2.1.5, 3.4.2, etc.)
     * Dates formatted correctly
     * CPIN flags (Yes or —)
     * Program codes (CRIIS, ACTS, ARDS)

Additional Testing:

Search Functionality:
- Tested search term "radar"
- Filtered to 1 result: "SW-RADAR-DSP-001 Radar Signal Processing"
- Shows "Showing 1 of 10 software versions"
- Search works across all text fields ✓

Type Filter:
- Selected "FIRMWARE" from dropdown
- Filtered to 5 results (only FIRMWARE type software)
- Shows "Showing 5 of 5 software versions"
- Filter properly triggers backend API call ✓

Console Verification:
- Zero JavaScript errors ✓
- Only expected React Router future flag warnings ✓
- No API errors ✓
- All network requests successful ✓

Screenshots Captured:
- feature168_software_catalog_page.png - Initial page load
- feature168_software_catalog_working.png - Full table with proper dates
- feature168_software_catalog_filtered.png - FIRMWARE filter applied

Technical Implementation Notes:
- Fixed interface mismatch between frontend and backend:
  * Backend uses: eff_date, cpin_flag, program_cd
  * Initial frontend had: effective_date, cpin, program.pgm_cd
  * Updated frontend to match backend structure
- Sort functionality handles both string and date fields
- Date formatting uses toLocaleDateString for consistency
- Type filter dynamically populated from available software types
- Software descriptions truncated with max-w-xs class
- Hover effects on table rows for better UX
- Color-coded type badges for visual distinction
