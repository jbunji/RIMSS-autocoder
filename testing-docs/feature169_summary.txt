Feature #169: Create software version record - IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED

Implementation Summary:
Added complete software creation functionality allowing administrators to create
new software version records through a modal dialog form.

Backend Implementation (backend/src/index.ts):

1. Made softwareCatalog mutable:
   - Changed from const to let
   - Added nextSwId counter (starting at 11)

2. POST /api/software endpoint (lines 10753-10859):
   - Admin-only access control
   - Comprehensive field validation
   - Duplicate software number checking
   - Program validation
   - Creates new Software record with auto-incremented ID
   - Returns transformed response with frontend-expected field names

3. Updated GET /api/software endpoint:
   - Transform backend field names (eff_date -> effective_date, cpin_flag -> cpin)

Frontend Implementation (frontend/src/pages/SoftwarePage.tsx):

1. "Add Software" button (visible to admin users only)
2. Modal dialog with complete form
3. Form validation and error handling
4. Auto-refresh after successful creation
