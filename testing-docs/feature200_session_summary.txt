ASSIGNMENT
================================================================================

This was a PARALLEL EXECUTION session. Feature #200 was pre-assigned via the
"SINGLE FEATURE MODE" instructions in the system prompt.

- No feature_get_next call needed
- Immediately marked feature as in-progress
- Focused exclusively on Feature #200

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
================================================================================

Feature was ALREADY FULLY IMPLEMENTED - verification only.

The application already had comprehensive confirmation dialogs for all
destructive operations:

- Configuration deletion
- Maintenance event deletion
- TCTO record deletion

All following the same secure pattern:
- Modal dialog blocks background interaction
- Warning message: "This action cannot be undone"
- Entity details displayed for user verification
- Two-button layout: Cancel (gray) vs Delete (red)
- Dialog closes on both actions
