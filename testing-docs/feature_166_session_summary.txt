Feature #166: ETM validation (out >= in) - VERIFIED AND PASSING

Assignment: PARALLEL SESSION - Pre-assigned feature #166
Session Type: Single-feature regression verification mode

FEATURE DESCRIPTION:
Meter out must be >= in unless meter changed. Validates that ETI Out (Engine Time
Indicator meter reading at repair end) is greater than or equal to ETI In (meter
reading at repair start), with exception for meter replacement scenarios.

INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:

   - Backend: backend/src/index.ts - validation logic confirmed
   - Frontend: frontend/src/pages/MaintenanceDetailPage.tsx - UI with meter_changed checkbox
   - Validation: eti_out must be >= eti_in unless meter_changed flag is true
   - Error handling: Clear error messages guide users to checkbox

Live Application Evidence - PASS:
   - Accessed maintenance event MX-2024-001 at http://localhost:5173/maintenance/1
