   - Authentication successful

✅ Step 2: Click Assets in sidebar
   - Clicked "Assets" link in the left sidebar

   - Client-side routing working (no page reload)

✅ Step 4: Verify assets table loads
   - Assets page loaded successfully
   - Heading displayed: "Assets"
   - Program context shown: "Viewing assets for CRIIS - Common Remotely Operated Integrated Reconnaissance System"
   - Asset count displayed: "10 total assets"
   - Complete table with 10 rows of asset data:
     * CRIIS-001 through CRIIS-010
     * All columns populated (Serial Number, Part Number, Name, Status, Location, ETI Hours, Next PMI, Actions)
     * Status badges displayed correctly (FMC, PMC, NMCM, NMCS, CNDM)
     * Bad Actor flag visible on CRIIS-005
     * Transit flag visible on CRIIS-009

   - Filter controls loaded (Search box, Status dropdown, Refresh button)
   - Export buttons present (Export PDF, Export Excel)
   - Add Asset button visible (admin permission)
   - Status legend displayed at bottom

Technical Verification:

✓ Navigation Implementation:
  - Assets link in sidebar: /assets
  - React Router navigation working correctly
  - Active state applied to Assets link when on /assets route
  - Active state shown with blue background highlighting
  - Active state removed from Dashboard link when navigating away

✓ UI/UX Details:
  - Sidebar link has icon + text label
  - Smooth navigation transition without page flicker
  - Client-side routing (no full page reload)
  - Browser URL bar updates correctly
  - Back button would work (browser history preserved)

✓ Console Status:

  - Zero console warnings related to navigation
  - Only expected React Router future flags (unrelated)
  - Token refresh scheduled (normal operation)

✓ Additional Testing:
  - Tested bidirectional navigation: Dashboard → Assets → Dashboard → Assets
