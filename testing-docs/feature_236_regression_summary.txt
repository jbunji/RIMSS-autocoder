FEATURE #236 REGRESSION TEST SUMMARY
=====================================

Test Date: 2026-01-20 UTC
Feature: Required field validation - empty submission blocked
Status: PASSING ✅ (No regression found)

OVERVIEW:
This regression test verified that form validation for required fields 
continues to work correctly, preventing submission when required fields 
are left empty.

TEST RESULTS:
✅ All 7 verification steps passed
✅ Error messages displayed correctly for all 5 required fields
✅ Form submission blocked (modal remained open)
✅ No data created (asset count remained at 14)
✅ Zero console errors
✅ Professional user experience maintained

VALIDATION TESTED:
1. Part Number (required) - Error: "Part number is required"
2. Serial Number (required) - Error: "Serial number is required"
3. Status (required) - Error: "Status is required"
4. Administrative Location (required) - Error: "Administrative location is required"
5. Custodial Location (required) - Error: "Custodial location is required"

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Client-side validation using React Hook Form + Zod
- Inline error messages displayed below each field
- Red text color for high visibility
- Form remains open for user to correct errors
- No API call made when validation fails

EVIDENCE:
- Screenshots: feature_236_validation_errors.png, feature_236_no_data_created.png
- Browser automation verified actual UI behavior
- Database count verified via UI (14 assets unchanged)

CONCLUSION:
Feature #236 is working correctly with no regressions detected. 
The required field validation continues to provide robust data 
integrity protection and excellent user experience.
