================================================================================

Feature #243: Duplicate unique values rejected - VERIFIED AND PASSING ✅

Assignment: PARALLEL SESSION - Pre-assigned feature #243

Test Execution - All 6 Steps PASSED:

✅ Step 1: Log in as admin
   - Logged in successfully as admin/admin123
   - User: John Admin (ADMIN role)
   - Full system access confirmed

✅ Step 2: Create user with email 'test@example.com'
   - Navigated to Admin > Users
   - Clicked "Add User" button
   - Filled form:
     * Username: test_user_1
     * Email: test@example.com
     * First Name: Test
     * Last Name: User1
     * Role: Viewer
     * Program: CRIIS
     * Password: TestPassword123!
   - Clicked "Create User"
   - Success message: "User 'test_user_1' created successfully!"
   - User appears in table with email test@example.com

✅ Step 3: Create another user with same email
   - Clicked "Add User" again
   - Filled form with DIFFERENT username but SAME email:
     * Username: test_user_2
     * Email: test@example.com (DUPLICATE)
     * First Name: Test
     * Last Name: User2
     * Role: Viewer
     * Program: CRIIS
     * Password: TestPassword123!
   - Clicked "Create User"

✅ Step 4: Verify error about duplicate email
   - Error message displayed: "Email already exists" ✓
   - Error shown in red at top of form
   - API returned 400 Bad Request (correct)
   - Form remained open (not closed)
   - No user created in database
   - Console error logged (expected): "Failed to load resource: 400 (Bad Request)"

✅ Step 5: Change email to unique value
   - Changed email field from 'test@example.com' to 'test2@example.com'
   - All other fields remained the same
   - Form stayed open after error (good UX)

✅ Step 6: Verify success
   - Clicked "Create User" with unique email
   - Success message: "User 'test_user_2' created successfully!" ✓
   - User appears in table with email test2@example.com
   - Both users now visible in table:
     * test_user_1 - test@example.com
     * test_user_2 - test2@example.com
   - Form closed automatically after success
   - No errors in console

Database Verification:

✓ API Verification:
  - Queried /api/users endpoint
  - Both users present in database:
    * "email":"test@example.com"
    * "email":"test2@example.com"
  - Real data persisted (not mock data)
  - Unique constraint enforced correctly

✓ Backend Validation:
  - Server rejected duplicate email with 400 status
  - Error message returned to frontend
  - Database integrity maintained
  - No partial records created

Technical Implementation:

✓ Unique Constraint Enforcement:
  - Database: email field has @unique constraint
  - Backend: Prisma throws error on duplicate
  - Frontend: Error message displayed clearly
  - HTTP Status: 400 Bad Request (correct)
  - Error Message: "Email already exists" (clear and specific)

✓ User Experience:
  - Error message displayed prominently in red
  - Form remains open for correction (good UX)
  - User can fix error and resubmit
  - Success message after correction
  - Clear feedback at each step

✓ Console Status:
  - Zero JavaScript errors ✅
  - Only expected warnings (React Router future flags)
  - Expected 400 error for duplicate (logged correctly)
  - Clean execution throughout all steps

Screenshots Captured:
