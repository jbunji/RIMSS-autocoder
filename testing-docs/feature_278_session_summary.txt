Feature #278: Submit button disabled during processing - VERIFIED AND PASSING ✅

Assignment: PARALLEL SESSION - Pre-assigned feature #278
Session Type: Single-feature verification mode

FEATURE DESCRIPTION:
Submit button prevents double-click. When users submit forms, the submit button
should become disabled during processing to prevent duplicate submissions.

VERIFICATION APPROACH:

This feature was already fully implemented in the codebase. I performed:
1. Comprehensive code analysis of all form components
2. Browser automation testing with real form submissions
3. Verification of disabled state and loading indicators

CODE ANALYSIS - ALL FORMS IMPLEMENT CORRECTLY:

1. AssetsPage.tsx (line 1315):
   - disabled={isSubmitting}
   - {isSubmitting ? 'Creating...' : 'Create Asset'}
   - CSS: disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed

2. SparesPage.tsx (lines 1664, 1667):
   - disabled={isSubmitting}
   - {isSubmitting ? 'Saving...' : 'Save Changes'}
   - Same disabled state management

3. ConfigurationsPage.tsx:
   - disabled={isSubmitting}
   - Consistent implementation pattern

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

✅ React Hook Form Integration:
   - Uses formState: { isSubmitting } from useForm hook
   - Automatically managed by React Hook Form during async operations
   - No manual state management needed

✅ Button Disabled Attribute:
   - disabled={isSubmitting} prevents all click events
   - Browser-level protection against double-clicks
   - Works even with rapid clicking

✅ Visual Feedback:
   - Tailwind CSS classes: disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed
   - Button appears dimmed when disabled
   - Cursor changes to not-allowed icon
   - Loading text: "Creating..." / "Saving..." / "Processing..."

BROWSER TESTING - All 6 Steps PASSED:

✅ Step 1: Log in as depot manager
✅ Step 2: Navigate to form (Assets page)
✅ Step 3: Click submit (filled form with test data)
✅ Step 4: Verify button becomes disabled (disabled={isSubmitting})
✅ Step 5: Verify loading indicator shows (text: "Creating...")
✅ Step 6: Verify can't click again (only one request sent)

SCREENSHOTS CAPTURED:
1. feature_278_step3_before_submit.png - Form filled, ready to submit
2. feature_278_step4_button_disabled_during_submit.png - Button disabled state
3. feature_278_complete_success_message.png - Success after submission

Result: Feature #278 marked as PASSING ✅

Progress: 276/374 features passing (73.8%)

Session Type: PARALLEL SESSION - Single Feature Mode
Session Duration: ~20 minutes
Code Changes: None required (already implemented correctly)
Quality: Production-ready idempotency protection ✅
