Feature #294: Search with only spaces handled - VERIFIED AND PASSING ✅

Assignment: PARALLEL SESSION - Pre-assigned feature #294
Session Type: Single-feature implementation mode

FEATURE DESCRIPTION:
Whitespace-only search works correctly. When users enter only spaces in a
search field, the application should handle it gracefully without errors,
either showing all results or a "no results" message, and continue working
normally.

TEST EXECUTION - All 5 Steps PASSED:

✅ Step 1: Log in as any user
   - Logged in as admin user (username: admin, password: admin123)
   - Authentication successful
   - Redirected to dashboard

✅ Step 2: Enter only spaces in search
   - Assets page: Entered "     " (5 spaces) in search textbox
   - Maintenance page: Entered "     " (5 spaces) in search textbox
   - Sorties page: Entered "     " (5 spaces) in search textbox

✅ Step 3: Verify all results or 'no results' message
   - Assets page: Shows all 10 assets (correct - treats whitespace as empty)
   - Maintenance page: Shows all 4 events (correct - treats whitespace as empty)
   - Sorties page: Shows all 4 sorties with filter badge (correct behavior)
   - All pages display complete data sets as expected

✅ Step 4: Verify no error
   - Zero JavaScript errors in console ✓
   - Only expected warnings (React Router future flags)
   - All API requests return 200 OK status
   - No network errors or failed requests

✅ Step 5: Verify can continue normally
   - Application continues to work smoothly
   - Can clear search and enter new queries
   - Navigation works correctly
   - All interactive elements functional

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

Backend Changes (backend/src/index.ts):
Fixed all search endpoints to properly trim whitespace and treat empty
strings as null (no filter applied):

1. Assets endpoint (line 7945)
2. Configurations endpoint (line 12086)
3. Maintenance events endpoint (lines 3922-3931)
4. Parts orders endpoint (line 10045)
5. Sorties endpoint (line 13050)
6. Software endpoint (line 11551)
7. Additional asset-related searches (lines 5044, 5390)

Pattern Applied: .trim() || null ensures empty strings become null

Result: Feature #294 marked as PASSING ✅
Progress: 293/374 features passing (78.3%)

Session Duration: ~45 minutes
Testing Method: Full end-to-end browser automation with visual verification
Quality: Production-ready edge case handling ✅
