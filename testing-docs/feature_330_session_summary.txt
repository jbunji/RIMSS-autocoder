================================================================================

Session Type: SINGLE FEATURE MODE (Parallel Execution)
Date: 2026-01-20
Feature ID: 330
Feature Name: Today/This Week filters work correctly
Category: temporal
Status: VERIFIED PASSING ✅
Progress: 330/374 features passing (88.2%)

================================================================================
FEATURE DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

Relative date filters work properly. Users can quickly filter report data by
clicking "Today" or "This Week" buttons instead of manually entering dates.

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

Added quick filter buttons to report pages with date filtering:
1. Sortie Report page (/reports/sorties)
2. Parts Ordered Report page (/reports/parts-ordered)

Two filter functions implemented:
- setTodayFilter(): Sets both start/end dates to current date
- setThisWeekFilter(): Sets start to Sunday, end to today

Technical details:
- Week starts on Sunday (US convention, dayOfWeek = 0)
- Uses JavaScript Date API with timezone awareness
- Auto-refresh via useEffect when dates change
- ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for HTML date inputs

================================================================================
